# Flash Card App Take-Home Assessment 

Please see the provided requirements document for project guidance after cloning this repo.

# Notes on the branches
## 'main' 
- holds the version that connects to an AWS DynamoDB, however it requires credentials so it will not run locally. If you want to run it, I can provide the environments file for a short amount of time, but will delete the keys after. I am trying to get it hosted on a server so that it can be played around with and will let you know if I am able to do that in time. 
## 'Runs-Locally-No-Database' 
- the version that you can pull and run locally. 
## 'Flash-Cards-w/-Multiple-Test-View' 
- a deprecated version where the user can take the test while viewing all cards on the screen (instead of one at a time).




## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
